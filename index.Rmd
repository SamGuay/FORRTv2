## What is FORRT?
***

Current norms for the teaching and mentoring of higher-education are rooted in obsolete practices of bygone eras. Improving transparency and rigor of science is the responsibility of all who engage in it, but ongoing attempts have neglected an essential aspect of the academic machinery: students. FORRT, a Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training, is introduced to raise awareness of the pedagogical implications of Open Science and its associated challenges (curricular reform, epistemological uncertainty, methods education, openness and social justice). Aimed at the training of researchers and consumers of science, FORRT is an effective, evolving, and community-driven framework toward the incremental adoption of principled teaching and mentoring practices, and supporting instructors by collating existing teaching pedagogies and materials to be reused and adapted for use within new and existing courses.

|      __*Meta-psychology special issue*__. We have an opportunity in conjunction with [Meta-Psychology](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology) and the [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/) to work on a recurring special issue. The call will request teaching materials, including the pedagogical aspect desired by FORRT. This will be an ongoing source of resources to curate with FORRT and for FORRT to disseminate. This also sets the stage for our vision of academia in which teaching resources are more valued - changing the publications structure to include these excellent and open resources is a part of this.
