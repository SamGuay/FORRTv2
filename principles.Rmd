## **A Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training**

</center>

FORRT is centred around a framework comprising six clusters of open and reproducible research practices. Each cluster has six sub-clusters.

### Cluster 1

<br><br>

#### **Cluster 1: Reproducibility crisis and Credibility Revolution**

<br>

**Summary**: Attainment of a grounding in the motivations and theoretical underpinnings of reproducible and open research. Integration with field specific content (i.e., or grounded in the history of replicability); 

* Replication crisis and credibility revolution
* Exploratory and confirmatory analyses
* Questionable research practices (their 'theory') and  prevalence
* Proposed improvement science initiatives on statistics, measurement, teaching, data sharing, code sharing, pre-registration, replication.
* Ongoing debates, (e.g. incentives for and against open science).
* Ethical considerations for improved practices.

Although not exhaustive, these concepts provide a broad coverage of this cluster.

### Cluster 2


<br><br>

#### **Cluster 2: Conceptual and Statistical Knowledge**

<br>

**Summary**: Enacting this principle indicates that students attain a grounding in fundamental statistics, measurement, and its implications. 

* The logic of null hypothesis testing, p-values, Type I and II errors (and when and why they might happen).
* Limitations and benefits of NHST, Bayesian and Likelihood approaches.
* Effect sizes, Statistical power, Confidence Intervals.
* Research Design, Sample Methods, and its implications for inferences.
* Questionable research (QRPs) & measurement practices (QMPs).
* Understand the relationship between all of the above.

Although not exhaustive, these concepts provide a broad coverage of this cluster.

### Cluster 3


<br><br>

#### **Cluster 3: Reproducible analyses**

<br>

**Summary**: Reproducible analyses allow the checking of analytic pipelines and facilitate error correction. Enacting this principle requires students to move towards transparent and scripted analysis practices.

* Strengths of reproducible pipelines
* Scripted analyses compared with GUI
* Data wrangling
* Programming reproducible data analyses
* Open source and free softwares
* Tools to check yourself and others; statcheck, GRIM, and SPRITE


Although not exhaustive, these concepts provide a broad coverage of this cluster.

### Cluster 4


<br><br>

#### **Cluster 4: Open data and materials**

<br>

**Summary**: Enacting this principle indicates that students have attained a grounding in open data and materials in both; using and sharing.

* Knowledge of traditional publication models. Open access publishing, preprints
* Reasons to share; for science, and for oneâ€™s own practices
* Repositories; e.g. OSF, FigShare, GitHub
* Accessing/sharing others data, code, and materials
* Ethical considerations
* Examples and consequences of accessing un/open data


Although not exhaustive, these concepts provide a broad coverage of this cluster.

### Cluster 5


<br><br>

#### **Cluster 5: Preregistration**

<br>

**Summary**: Preregistration entails laying out a complete methodology and analysis before a study has been undertaken. This facilitates transparency and removes several potential QRPs.



* Purpose of preregistration - distinguishing exploratory and confirmatory analyses, transparency measures
* Preregistration and registered reports - strengths and differences
* When can you preregister? Can you preregister secondary data?
* Writing a preregistration
* Comparing a preregistration to a final study manuscript
* Conducting a preregistered study



Although not exhaustive, these concepts provide a broad coverage of this cluster.

### Cluster 6


<br><br>

#### **Cluster 6: Replication research**

<br>

**Summary**:  Replication research takes a variety of forms, each with a different purpose and contribution. Reproducible science requires replication research. 

* Purposes of replication attempts - what is a 'failed' replication?
* Large scale replication attempts
* Distinguishing conceptual and direct replications
* Conducting replication studies; challenges, limitations, and comparisons with the original study
* Registered Replication Reports
* The politics of replicating famous studies


Although not exhaustive, these concepts provide a broad coverage of this cluster.
